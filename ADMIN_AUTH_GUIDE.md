# Admin Authentication System Guide

## Overview
The PepperTree Townhomes website now includes a complete admin authentication and user management system. This system protects administrative pages (like the applications list) and allows administrators to manage user accounts.

## Features
- **Session-based authentication** using PHP sessions
- **Role-based access control** (administrator vs user roles)
- **User management interface** for adding/removing admin accounts
- **Modal-based UI** for login and user management
- **Secure password handling** (backend validation)
- **Persistent sessions** across page refreshes

## Default Admin Account
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Email:** admin@peppertreetownhomes.com
- **Role:** Administrator

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Change the default password immediately after first login!

## Files & Structure

### Backend Files
1. **users.json** - User database (JSON format)
   - Stores: username, password, email, role, createdAt, lastLogin
   - Located in root directory

2. **auth.php** - Authentication API
   - POST: Login with username/password
   - GET: Check current session status
   - DELETE: Logout and destroy session

3. **manage_users.php** - User management API (admin only)
   - GET: List all users (passwords excluded)
   - POST: Create new user
   - DELETE: Remove user (prevents self-deletion)

### Frontend Files
1. **admin-auth.js** - Authentication JavaScript
   - Login/logout functionality
   - User management (add, list, delete)
   - Session checking on page load
   - Modal controls
   - Notification system

2. **admin-auth.css** - Authentication styles
   - Auth button styling (top right corner)
   - Modal designs (login, user management, add user)
   - Table styling for users list
   - Responsive design

### Integrated Pages
- **applications-list.html** - Applications dashboard with auth
- **view-application.html** - Individual application viewer with auth

## How It Works

### Sign In Process
1. User clicks "üîê Sign In" button (top right corner)
2. Login modal appears with username/password fields
3. Credentials are validated against `users.json`
4. On success:
   - PHP session is created
   - `lastLogin` timestamp is updated
   - Button changes to "üë§ [username]"
   - User gains access to admin features

### User Management
1. Admin clicks on username button ‚Üí Admin menu appears
2. Clicks "üë• Manage Users" ‚Üí User management modal opens
3. View all users with:
   - Username, email, role
   - Created date, last login
   - Delete button (except for current user)

### Adding New Users
1. In User Management modal, click "‚ûï Add User"
2. Fill out form:
   - Username (3+ characters, must be unique)
   - Email (valid email format)
   - Password (6+ characters minimum)
   - Role (Administrator or User)
3. Click "Save User" ‚Üí New account is created
4. New entry added to `users.json`

### Logout
1. Click username button ‚Üí Admin menu
2. Click "üö™ Logout"
3. Session destroyed
4. Returns to "üîê Sign In" button

## Security Features
- **Session-based authentication**: Uses PHP `$_SESSION` for secure state management
- **Role-based access control**: User management requires administrator role
- **Duplicate username prevention**: Cannot create multiple accounts with same username
- **Self-deletion protection**: Admins cannot delete their own account
- **Password validation**: Minimum length requirements enforced
- **HTTP status codes**: Proper error handling (400, 401, 403, 500)

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users (Admins)
1. **First-time setup:**
   - Navigate to applications-list.html
   - Click "üîê Sign In" button
   - Login with default credentials (admin/admin123)
   - Go to Manage Users ‚Üí click your username ‚Üí Add new password

2. **Daily use:**
   - Sign in when accessing admin pages
   - Session persists while browser is open
   - Can manage applications without re-authenticating
   - Sign out when finished

3. **Adding team members:**
   - Sign in as administrator
   - Click username ‚Üí "üë• Manage Users"
   - Click "‚ûï Add User"
   - Fill in details and select role
   - New user receives credentials via email (manual process)

### For Developers
1. **Adding auth to new pages:**
   ```html
   <!-- In <head> -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="admin-auth.css">
   
   <!-- Before </body> -->
   <button id="authButton">üîê Sign In</button>
   <div id="adminMenu">...</div>
   <!-- Include all modals (login, user mgmt, add user) -->
   <script src="admin-auth.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Checking auth in JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   // admin-auth.js provides global currentUser variable
   if (currentUser && currentUser.role === 'administrator') {
       // Show admin-only features
   }
   ```

3. **Protecting PHP endpoints:**
   ```php
   session_start();
   if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
       http_response_code(401);
       echo json_encode(['error' => 'Unauthorized']);
       exit;
   }
   ```

## Testing Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load users"

- Verify PHP has write permissions to the file
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### "Session not persisting"
- Ensure PHP session is enabled in php.ini
- Check that cookies are enabled in browser
- Verify session_start() is called in auth.php

### "Cannot add user"
- Check username isn't already taken
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check users.json file permissions (must be writable)

### "Unauthorized" errors
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Log out and log back in
- Check that session hasn't expired

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Email notifications for new accounts
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Activity logging / audit trail

## Security Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** This is a basic authentication system suitable for small internal tools. For production use with sensitive data, consider:
- Hashing passwords (bcrypt, argon2)
- HTTPS/SSL encryption
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- More robust session management
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with data protection regulations
