## 🔧 Technical Details

### Email Link Format
All email links use the standard `mailto:` protocol:

```html
<a href="mailto:rent@peppertreetownhomes.com">rent@peppertreetownhomes.com</a>
```

### JavaScript Email Functions
Functions that trigger email use the full mailto URL:

```javascript
window.location.href = `mailto:rent@peppertreetownhomes.com?subject=${subject}&body=${body}`;
```

### Form Submissions
Contact forms display the email address but will need backend integration to actually send emails. Currently they show success messages but don't send emails automatically.
