# ✅ Appointments View - FIXED

## Problem Resolved
❌ **Before**: Clicking "View" button didn't navigate to appointment details
✅ **After**: Clicking "View" button now correctly shows the specific appointment

## What Was Changed

### 1. File: `list_appointments.php`
**Issue**: Returning full filename IDs like `apt_test123`
**Fix**: Extract just the suffix (`test123`)

```php
// Extract ID from filename, removing 'apt_' prefix
$filename = basename($file, '.json');
$id = preg_replace('/^apt_/', '', $filename);
$appointments[] = [
    'id' => $data['id'] ?? $id,  // Use stored ID, fallback to extracted ID
    ...
];
```

### 2. Files: Appointment JSON files
**Issue**: IDs stored as `apt_test123`
**Fix**: Updated to store just `test123`

```
appointments/apt_test123.json  → {"id": "test123", ...}
appointments/apt_demo456.json  → {"id": "demo456", ...}
```
